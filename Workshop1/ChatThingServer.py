Project 1: encrypted chat

Design a secure chat system, with the following features:

● A separate server that only handles key and message exchange
● Encrypted group chats
● Persistent chat logs that are loaded if you close and reopen the program

You can assume the server can be trusted for the key exchange, but it should not
be able to decode messages
